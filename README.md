# TokenTrader
Decentralised trustless ERC20-compliant token to ETH exchange contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

There are two types of these contracts:

* **TokenTrader** - The original REP TokenTrader that allows users to buy or sell ERC20-compliant tokens

* **TokenSeller** - A modified TokenTrader customised to handle the partial ERC20 compliance of the Golem Network Token where the `approve(...)`, `transferFrom(...)` and `allowance(...)` methods are not implemented.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/TokenTrader/wiki) for the latest information.
